Integrate Strix into your GitHub workflow to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## Basic Workflow

```yaml .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  strix-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Strix
        run: curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash

      - name: Run Security Scan
        env:
          STRIX_LLM: ${{ secrets.STRIX_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
        run: strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick
```

## Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `STRIX_LLM` | Model name (e.g., `openai/gpt-5`) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | API key for your LLM provider |

## Exit Codes

The workflow fails when vulnerabilities are found:

| Code | Result |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Pass — No vulnerabilities |
| 2 | Fail — Vulnerabilities found |

## Scan Modes for CI

| Mode | Duration | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `quick` | Minutes | Every PR |
| `standard` | ~30 min | Nightly builds |
| `deep` | 1-4 hours | Release candidates |

<Tip>
Use `quick` mode for PRs to keep feedback fast. Schedule `deep` scans nightly.
