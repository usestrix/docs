Prompt modules are structured knowledge packages that give Strix agents deep expertise in specific vulnerability types, technologies, and testing methodologies.

## The Insight

LLMs have broad but shallow security knowledge. They know *about* SQL injection, but lack the nuanced techniques that experienced pentesters use—parser quirks, bypass methods, validation tricks, and chain attacks.

Prompt modules inject this deep, specialized knowledge directly into the agent's context, transforming it from a generalist into a specialist for the task at hand.

## How They Work

When Strix spawns an agent for a specific task, it selects up to 5 relevant prompt modules based on the context:

```python
# Agent created for JWT testing automatically loads relevant modules
create_agent(
    task="Test authentication mechanisms",
    prompt_modules=["authentication_jwt", "business_logic"]
)
```

The modules are injected into the agent's system prompt, giving it access to:

- **Advanced techniques** — Non-obvious methods beyond standard testing
- **Working payloads** — Practical examples with variations
- **Validation methods** — How to confirm findings and avoid false positives
- **Edge cases** — Version-specific quirks and environment nuances

## Module Structure

Each module uses XML-style tags for structure:

```xml
<vulnerability_guide>
  <title>VULNERABILITY NAME</title>
  
  <critical>Key insight about this vulnerability</critical>
  
  <scope>What this module covers</scope>
  
  <methodology>Step-by-step testing approach</methodology>
  
  <discovery_techniques>How to find it</discovery_techniques>
  
  <exploitation_techniques>How to exploit it</exploitation_techniques>
  
  <bypass_techniques>How to bypass protections</bypass_techniques>
  
  <validation>How to confirm findings</validation>
  
  <false_positives>What to watch out for</false_positives>
  
  <pro_tips>Expert advice</pro_tips>
</vulnerability_guide>
```

## Contributing Modules

Community contributions are welcome. Good modules include:

1. **Real-world techniques** — Methods that work in practice
2. **Practical payloads** — Working examples with variations
3. **Validation steps** — How to confirm without false positives
4. **Context awareness** — Version/environment-specific behavior

See the [Contributing Guide](/contributing) to submit new modules.
