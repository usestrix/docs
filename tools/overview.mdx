## How Tools Work

Strix runs inside a Docker sandbox. Each tool operates within this isolated environment, allowing the agent to:

1. **Browse** target applications like a real user
2. **Intercept** and modify HTTP traffic
3. **Execute** commands and scripts
4. **Analyze** source code for vulnerabilities
5. **Validate** findings with working PoCs
