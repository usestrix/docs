Strix agents use specialized tools to test your applications like a real penetration tester would.

## Core Tools

## Additional Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Python Runtime | Write and execute custom exploit scripts |
| File Editor | Read and modify source code |
| Web Search | Real-time OSINT via Perplexity |
| Notes | Document findings during the scan |
| Reporting | Generate vulnerability reports with PoCs |

## How It Works

Strix runs inside a Docker container with a full Kali Linux environment. The agent:

1. **Browses** your application through Chrome, with all traffic routed through the proxy
2. **Analyzes** captured requests to identify interesting endpoints
3. **Replays** requests with modified payloads to test for vulnerabilities
4. **Validates** findings using terminal tools and custom scripts
5. **Reports** confirmed vulnerabilities with proof-of-concepts
