Strix has access to a persistent bash terminal running inside the Docker sandbox. This gives the agent access to all [pre-installed security tools](/tools/sandbox).

## Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Persistent state | Working directory and environment persist between commands |
| Multiple sessions | Run parallel terminals for concurrent operations |
| Background jobs | Start long-running processes without blocking |
| Interactive | Respond to prompts and control running processes |

## Common Uses

### Running Security Tools

```bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d example.com

# Vulnerability scanning
nuclei -u https://example.com

# SQL injection testing
sqlmap -u "https://example.com/page?id=1"
```

### Code Analysis

```bash
# Search for secrets
trufflehog filesystem ./

# Static analysis
semgrep --config auto ./src

# Grep for patterns
grep -r "password" ./
```

### Custom Scripts

```bash
# Run Python exploits
python3 exploit.py

# Execute shell scripts
./test_auth_bypass.sh
```

## Session Management

The agent can run multiple terminal sessions concurrently:

- Main session for primary testing
- Secondary session for monitoring
- Background processes for servers or watchers
