Strix uses a headless Chrome browser via Playwright to interact with web applications exactly like a real user would.

## How It Works

All browser traffic is automatically routed through the Caido proxy, giving Strix full visibility into every request and response. This enables:

- Testing client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, DOM manipulation)
- Navigating authenticated flows (login, OAuth, MFA)
- Triggering JavaScript-heavy functionality
- Capturing dynamically generated requests

## Capabilities

| Action     | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Navigate   | Go to URLs, follow links, handle redirects  |
| Click      | Interact with buttons, links, form elements |
| Type       | Fill in forms, search boxes, input fields   |
| Execute JS | Run custom JavaScript in the page context   |
| Screenshot | Capture visual state for reports            |
| Multi-tab  | Test across multiple browser tabs           |

## Example Flow

1. Agent launches browser and navigates to login page
2. Fills in credentials and submits form
3. Proxy captures the authentication request
4. Agent navigates to protected areas
5. Tests for IDOR by replaying requests with modified IDs
