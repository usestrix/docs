Strix uses a Playwright-controlled Chrome browser for testing client-side vulnerabilities.

## Capabilities

- **Multi-tab sessions** — Test multiple pages simultaneously
- **JavaScript execution** — Run custom scripts in page context
- **Form interaction** — Click, type, and navigate like a real user
- **Screenshot capture** — Visual verification of exploits
- **Console monitoring** — Capture JavaScript errors and logs

## Use Cases

### XSS Testing

The browser can inject payloads and verify JavaScript execution in the DOM.

### Authentication Flows

Test login, session management, and OAuth flows by navigating through the actual UI.

### CSRF Validation

Open multiple tabs to test cross-site request forgery with different sessions.

### DOM-Based Vulnerabilities

Execute JavaScript to inspect and manipulate the DOM for client-side issues.
