Strix includes a full HTTP proxy for traffic interception and manipulation.

## Capabilities

- **Request capture** — Log all HTTP traffic from the browser
- **Request replay** — Repeat requests with modifications
- **HTTPQL filtering** — Query traffic with Caido-style syntax
- **Scope management** — Filter by domain or path patterns
- **Sitemap generation** — Visualize discovered attack surface

## Workflow

1. **Browse** the target with the browser tool
2. **List** captured requests with filters
3. **Replay** interesting requests with modified parameters
4. **Validate** vulnerabilities with crafted payloads

## HTTPQL Examples

```
# POST requests to API endpoints
req.method.regex:"POST" AND req.path.cont:"/api/"

# Requests with specific response codes
resp.code.gte:400

# Filter by host
req.host.regex:".*api.example.com"
```

## Scope Management

Create scopes to focus on specific parts of the application:

```
# Allowlist
["api.example.com", "*.example.com"]

# Denylist (exclude static assets)
["*.gif", "*.jpg", "*.png", "*.css", "*.js"]
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Request modification | Change headers, body, cookies |
| Response analysis | Search for patterns in responses |
| Sitemap view | Hierarchical endpoint discovery |
