Strix offers three scan modes to balance speed and thoroughness.

## Quick

```bash
strix --target ./app --scan-mode quick
```

Fast checks for obvious vulnerabilities. Best for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Pull request validation
- Rapid smoke tests

**Duration**: Minutes

## Standard

```bash
strix --target ./app --scan-mode standard
```

Balanced testing for routine security reviews. Best for:
- Regular security assessments
- Pre-release validation
- Development milestones

**Duration**: 30 minutes to 1 hour

## Deep

```bash
strix --target ./app --scan-mode deep
```

Thorough penetration testing. Best for:
- Comprehensive security audits
- Pre-production reviews
- Critical application assessments

**Duration**: 1-4 hours depending on target complexity

<Note>
Deep mode is the default. It explores edge cases, chained vulnerabilities, and complex attack paths.

## Choosing a Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
